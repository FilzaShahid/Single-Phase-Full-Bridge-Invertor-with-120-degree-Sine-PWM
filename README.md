# Single-Phase-Full-Bridge-Invertor-with-120-degree-Sine-PWM
Modeling and simulation of single phase full bridge inverter as a frequency changer modulated by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM).

Inverter is the most important device to utilize the renewable energy sources eciently. We cannot store energy in the form
of Alternating current; it is always stored in the form of Direct Current. An inverter is
a circuit that converts DC sources to AC sources. The Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation
(SPWM) technique is one of the most popular PWM techniques for harmonic
reduction of inverters. The 120 degree conduction PWM and SPWM switching
signal is generated with the help of dierent FPGAs, micro controllers and microprocessors
through coding. The concept of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for inverters is
described with analyses extended to dierent kinds of PWM strategies. In the end, the
simulation and hardware results for a single-phase inverter using the PWM strategies
described are presented and analyzed.
